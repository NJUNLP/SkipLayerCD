# Multilingual Contrastive Decoding via Language-agnostic Layers Skipping

## Overview
This repository shares the code and data of our latest work [Multilingual Contrastive Decoding via Language-agnostic Layers Skipping](https://arxiv.org/abs/xxx).

In this work, we find a critical problem of the recent amateur-free contrastive decoding method, DoLa, while working in non-English languages.
Then, we purpose a better amateur-free contrastive decoding approach, Skip Layer, and achieve significant performance improve on both English and Multilingual reasoning benchmarks.
